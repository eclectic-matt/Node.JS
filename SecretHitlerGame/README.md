# Secret Hitler Game

These are the files required to run a local game of Secret Hitler, allowing players to join the game by visiting a local IP address and view their secret roles, vote on the government and select policies without the need for physical cards.

See the official [Secret Hitler website](http://secrethitler.com) for more details on the game!

## Playing the game on your own local network

You will need Node.JS installed on one machine, which should have firewall settings which allow communication to this machine.

Then follow these steps:

* Clone this repository and navigate to the folder using cmd
* run "npm install" to install the dependencies (express, ip, socket.io)
* run the index file using "node index"
* Check cmd for the IP address and port for players to access the game
